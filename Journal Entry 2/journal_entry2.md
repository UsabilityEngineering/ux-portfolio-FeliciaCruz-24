## Description of Interaction

### Overview
I decided to try using my Mom's essential oil diffuser that she got as a Christmas gift. I have never used one before so I thought I would try using it and document my interaction 
using an essential oil fan diffuser.

### Steps
First thing I did was plug in the diffuser and pressed the power button. After I turned on the diffuser the top of it started changing colors.

Afterwards, I decided to start reading the directions because I wasn't sure what to do next and started following the directions.The directions said to make sure the diffuser was unplugged before pulling off the bottom of the diffuser.

After I pulled off the bottom off the bottom of the diffuser, I removed the top plastic cover that was on top of the absorbing pad and added 5 drops of the essential oil(orange
scent) to the absorbing pad. I added 5 drops of the oil because I wasn't sure how many to add and the instructions didn't tell me how many I should add.

I placed the cover back on top of the absorbing pad and then reconnected the bottom back to the diffuser.

I plugged the diffuser back in and I couldn't smell anything so I decided to add 10 more drops of the oil.

After that I could smell the orange fragrance more, but it was really intense. When I was done using the diffuser I pushed the power button and unplugged it.

## Usability Goals

I have had time to reflect on my interactions with the essential oil fan diffuser and I think that my experience went pretty well. I was able to use the directions
provided to help me figure out what to do and they were very easy to follow. The steps I did were very **memorable** and I can say for sure that if I decide to use the diffuser again I would be able to replicate the same steps I did without needing to follow the directions again. While reading through the directions I noticed that another usability goal that the air diffuser utilized was **safety**. In the directions it made sure to say that we needed to unlplug the diffuser before we remove the bottom of it to add essential oil to the absorbing pad which means that the creators of this product care about the **safety** of their users. 

Futhermore, I believe that this was a great product that had very clear directions and did what it was supposed to do. However, I would say that one weakness was that the directions didn't give me any guidance on how many drops of the essential oil I should add, so I had to make an educated guess and then make adjustments. Overall, even though I have never used an oil diffuser before I was able to figure out how to use it by following the directions and was able to get it to work correctly.
