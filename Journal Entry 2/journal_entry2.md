### Description of Interaction
I decided to try using my Mom's essential oil diffuser that she got as a Christmas gift. I have never used one before so I thought I would try using it and document my interaction 
using an essential oil fan diffuser.

1. First thing I did was plug in the diffuser and pressed the power button. After I turned on the diffuser the top of it started changing colors.
2. Afterwardss, I decided to start reading the directions because I wasn't sure what to do next and started following the directions.
3. The directions said to make sure the diffuser was unplugged before pulling off the bottom of the diffuser.
4. After I pulled off the bottom off the bottom of the diffuser, I removed the top plastic cover that was on top of the absorbing pad and added 5 drops of the essential oil(orange
scent) to the absorbing pad. I added 5 drops of the oil because I wasn't sure how many to add and the instructions didn't tell me how many I should add.
5. I placed the cover back on top of the absorbing pad and then reconnected the bottom back to the diffuser.
6. I plugged the diffuser back in and I couldn't smell anything so I decided to add 10 more drops of the oil.
7. After that I could smell the orange fragrance more, but it was really intense.
8. When I was done using the diffuser I pushed the power button and unplugged it.
